# NeoPixel Lighting for Raspberry Pi

This personal project uses RaspberryPi and Python as a control for individually addressable RGB LEDs, also known as Neopixels or WS2182b lights. The project is currently in a prototyping and coding phase, using a breadboard to connect all necessary components while testing various code on it.

## Components
1. Raspberry Pi
    - I use Rasberry Pi 3b, but I plan to use a simpler Pi in the future to lower power usage
2. WS2812b LED Strip
3. 5V power supply
4. Required wiring components
    - [I used this guide for wiring the NeoPixels](https://www.thegeekpub.com/15990/wiring-ws2812b-addressable-leds-to-the-raspbery-pi/) 

## Tools
1. Python
    - [Adafruit NeoPixels on Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/python-usage)
    - RPi.GPIO
